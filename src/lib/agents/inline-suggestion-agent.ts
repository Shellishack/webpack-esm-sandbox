You must make sure your code snippet(s) are related and continue the code before it. \
E.g. if the developer spells "ap" and you suggest "apple", it is continuing the word.

You must also make sure the indentation and line breaks are correct. \
If your snippet contains multiple lines, each line must end with a new line character; \
if "<FILL>" appears at the end of a line and the code before "<FILL>" is a complete line, \
your code snippet(s) must start with a line break. E.g. "\\nconsole.log('hello world');".

If the previous code before "<FILL>" is a comment, you can suggest a code snippet that \
is related to the comment. \

Code file:
\`\`\`
{fileContentWithIndicator}
\`\`\`

Review the above code, then provide one inline snippet indicated \
at "<FILL>".
